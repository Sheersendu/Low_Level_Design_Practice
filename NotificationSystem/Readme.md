Here’s a **summary of your cross-questions and answers** (with corrections/improvements) from the **notification system** discussion. This could serve as a strong behavioral + system design review summary, especially in an interview.

## ✅ **Cross Questions and Your (Refined) Answers**

### 1. **How do you plan to make notification delivery asynchronous?**

**Your Answer:**
I will use a Kafka topic per notification type (e.g., `email-topic`, `sms-topic`, `push-topic`). The producers will publish messages to the respective topics. Dedicated consumer workers will consume, send the actual notification, and update the delivery status.

➡️ **Refinement:**
Consider batching or rate-limiting consumers for cost efficiency. Also, partition topics appropriately for scalability (e.g., by user ID hash or region).

---

### 2. **How will you handle retries and failures?**

**Your Answer:**
Kafka provides out-of-the-box retry support. For failed messages, we will configure a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). Retry logic will use **exponential backoff** to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.

➡️ **Refinement:**
You can use Kafka retry topics (`_retry`, `_dlq`) or integrate a sidecar retry mechanism using a scheduler with attempt timestamps.

---

### 3. **How will templates be managed?**

**Your Answer:**

* For **short-term/event-based templates**, use **Redis** for fast access.
* For **long-lived or static templates**, store them in a **NoSQL DB** like MongoDB.
  Templates will be selected at runtime based on event type and user preferences.

---

### 4. **How will you handle multi-channel notifications (fallbacks)?**

**Your Answer:**
I’ll use the **Abstract Factory Pattern** to generate a composite notification with fallback channels (e.g., if email fails, try push or SMS). Each channel can be tried based on user preference or priority order.

➡️ **Refinement:**
Fallback logic can be coordinated by a strategy engine that pulls user preferences from a profile service or DB.

### 5. **How do you prevent the same message from being sent twice?**

**Your Initial Answer:**
By using flags like `IsProcessed` and `IsDelivered`.

➡️ **Corrected Answer:**

* Add a **unique Message ID** to every notification.
* Maintain a **deduplication store** (e.g., Redis or a table with a TTL) to track processed IDs.
* On receiving a notification, first check if the ID exists:

    * **If yes** → skip sending.
    * **If no** → proceed and mark it post-send.
* Store `attemptCount`, `status`, and `lastAttemptedTime` for better observability.

---

### 6. **How do you ensure idempotency in case the system crashes after sending but before updating the `IsDelivered` flag?**

**Your Corrected Answer:**

* Implement a **dedicated message log or outbox table** using a **transactional outbox pattern**.
* The send operation and DB update must be part of the **same atomic transaction**.
* If using Kafka, enable **exactly-once semantics** with transactional producers and a stateful consumer.

---

## 🚀 Additional Enhancements You Planned

* Used **Strategy Pattern** to dynamically switch notification sending strategies.
* Made `NotificationFactory` and `NotificationService` singletons for thread safety.
* Planned for **unit testing** (a nice touch if time allows).
* Skipped `IFileUploader`, `IFileValidator` as non-core in 30-min solution — valid tradeoff.

Separate Message Delivery Status Table (More Control)

Store in DB:

| messageId | status     | lastAttempted | retryCount | errorCode | userId | channel |
|-----------|------------|---------------|------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| msg123    | FAILED     | 2024-07-19     |     3      | TIMEOUT   | u001   | EMAIL   |

    This allows richer observability, analytics, and recovery via dashboard/UI.

    You can combine DLQ + DB tracking, where DLQ is for reprocessing and DB is for reporting.

🛠️ Recommendation for Your Use Case

    Idempotency	- Redis with fixed TTL (e.g., 24–48 hrs)
    Retries	- Kafka retry topic with exponential backoff
    Post max retry - Kafka DLQ + MessageStatus table (DB)
    Observability - Store message metadata in DB for audit
